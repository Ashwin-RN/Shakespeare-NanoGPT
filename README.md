# Shakespeare NanoGPT

This project implements a small-scale GPT-like language model using PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of Shakespeare's works and can generate text in a similar style.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch

Install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch
Usage
Training the Model
Update the file path to your dataset in the script:


file_path = 'C:\\Users\\ashwi\\source\\Data\\tinyshakespeare.txt'
Run the script to train the model. The model will be saved as bigram_model.pth after training.

Generating Text
After training, you can generate text using the trained model:

Uncomment the lines to load the saved model:


# model = BigramLanguageModel()
# model.load_state_dict(torch.load('bigram_model.pth'))
# m = model.to(device)
Run the script to generate text:


context = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long, device=device)
generated_text = decode(m.generate(context, max_new_tokens=2000)[0].tolist())
print(generated_text)
Model Architecture
The model consists of several layers:

Embedding layer for token and position embeddings
Transformer blocks with multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers
Final layer normalization and linear layer to predict the next token
Training
The model is trained using a cross-entropy loss function and the AdamW optimizer. Training data is split into train and validation sets, and the loss is evaluated periodically.

Generating Text
The generate method of the model generates text by sampling from the distribution of predicted next tokens iteratively.

Saving and Loading the Model
The trained model can be saved and loaded using PyTorch's torch.save and torch.load functions:


# Save the model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'bigram_model.pth')

# Load the model
# model = BigramLanguageModel()
# model.load_state_dict(torch.load('bigram_model.pth'))
# m = model.to(device)
Sample Output
Below is a sample output generated by the model:
